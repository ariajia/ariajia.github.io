				<h1>My Inspiration<br></h1>
						<p>
							My inspiration was mainly from <a href="https://www.kekewu.me/">this portfolio website</a>. She was my TA before, and she was a UX designer and researcher. Therefore, her portflio looks very aesthetic and gives people a good sense of working as a UX designer. Most of my projects are also about ux design, so I referred to her website a lot. 

							I used Boostraps column CSS and the hover state CSS to make my web page look more conciese and organized. I also made my own CSS file to change the background color and did some fonts editing. For the 'Contact me' page, I embeded a Google map link to my page.

							Here is my portfolio website. <a href="redesign.html">Click here</a>
