		<h1>What are or should be the limits of using online social platforms to engage in collective action?</h1>
		<p>I think the use of online social platforms to participate in collective action should be limited. The spontaneous action against Wall Street institutions initiated by ordinary people has not yet fully produced a result. Retail investors, Wall Street institutions, and multi-stakeholder parties are still in a stalemate. However, if Wall Street institutions ultimately use their own advantages to defeat retailers, we don't know what direction this incident will go. And the platform should have a certain regulatory responsibility for such collective activities, no matter what kind of collective activities. </p>

		<p>The Gamestop incident reminds me of the event that Tump’s supporters hit the Congress weeks ago. There are many similarities between these two collective activities. They are all activities organized by ordinary people on the social media platform spontaneously. They all reach a consensus, form a kind of ‘organization’, and then take action for their own interests. The impact on Congress has changed from online to offline violence, which seriously endangers public security and stability. Although the GameStop event is still only online (or maybe somehow offline), if the interests of retail investors are seriously damaged, whether there will be some violence is unknown. </p>

		<p>We have always advocated freedom of speech, which is definitely correct, but the ordinary people themselves often do not realize what kind of impact their actions may have on society. I think the platform should have a certain regulatory responsibility. Perhaps when Trump’s supporters expressed their dissatisfaction with the election results on the Internet and said that they want to carry out demonstrations, no one will think that the anger of the masses will accumulate to the extent that they dare to attack Congress. Similarly, at a time when people may feel passionate about the courage and unity of retail investors, no one will think whether this action will lead to a financial crisis in the United States again, or even more serious consequences. </p>

		<p>It is obviously inappropriate to force the closure of the discussion platform and restrict the user's actions because it will only aggravate the public. People will not stop acting, or even fight back in a more radical way. What's more, in such a society that emphasizes freedom, such behavior is challenging social justice. In this GameStop event, the platform should position itself rather than stand on the side of interests when the activity continues to develop. For example, in order to keep the richer people’s money, Wall Street institutions ordered the platform to shut down the forum. At the moment, this kind of behavior of obviously standing on the side of capitalists, which will inevitably lead to anger.</p>

		<p>To sum up, I do think that there should be limits to using online social platforms to engage in collective action. The collective action spontaneously formed by people on the Internet seems to be initiated by people for their legitimate rights and interests, but the actual consequences are unpredictable and dangerous. Although I did not propose a specific limit, I think the platform should support freedom of speech, properly use its rights, not abuse its regulatory power, and cut off the whole discussion space.</p>
